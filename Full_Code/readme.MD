### DAC-ADC parts and assembly

![](http://i.imgur.com/j1jujAp.jpg=100x20)

The product is based on openDACs's recipe. For more details:
http://opendacs.com/dac-adc-homepage/

### Output Voltage
The minimum step of the output voltage is approx:

$$ \Delta V = \frac{Max - Min}{2^{bits}} = \frac{10 - (-10)}{2^{16}} \approx 0.3\cdot10^{-3} volt $$

with this output voltage we can get a clear signal for $AC \approx 30 \cdot 10 ^{-3}\  volt$, and a good signal for $AC \approx 3 \cdot 10 ^-3\  volt$ (RMS).
### Communication
We copied most of OpenDAC's instructions that you can read about here:
http://opendacs.com/dac-adc-homepage/how-to-communicate-with-the-dac-adc/

The device communicates through the serial port (baudrate 115200) and accepts commands like:

	RAMP1,2,-4,4.8,50,10\r

Ramps the voltage on port 2 from $-4 \ volt$ to $4.8 \ volt$ in 50 steps with 10 microseconds of delay. Commands always end with '\r' (13 in ASCII). The device ignores any '\n's.

### Code structure

The DAC-ADC actions are controlled in the 
    
    void router(std::vector<String> DB)

function. This command accepts a vector of strings (mutable list) called DB that came from the Serial connection. Each string in the vector represents an argument of the given command. for example the command:
    
    RAMP1,2,-4,4.8,50,10\r

Would result in DB[0] being 'RAMP1' and DB[5] being the string '10'. There are Arduino String so DB[5].toInt() would be the number 10.
#### useful functions
    float writeDAC(int dacChannel, float voltage)

Writes the requested voltage to the dacChannel.

    void readADC(byte DB)

Reads the voltage on a single channel (the DB parameter) and writes it though the Serial connection.

    float readADCWithoutPrint(byte DB)

Reads the current voltage of a single channel and return its value as a floating point number. Duck only. 

### The Duck version

The duck version currently has 1 additional command:

* SINE

After the initial connection to the device, the Duck sends a single '\n' that should be cleared from its output (or just read but the software).

## Sine
Command signature:

	SINE,{DAC_CHANNEL},{DC_VOLTAGE},{AC_AMPLITUDE},{FREQUENCY},{POINTS_ON_GRAPH}\r

* DAC_CHANNEL - Output channel. In addition to the requested channel, the same signal would come out of channel 3 as reference channel. The AC current of the reference channel can be changed using the RF command (more details below).
* DC_VOLTAGE - The initial DC voltage out of the output channel. This doesn't affect the reference port.
* AC_AMPLITUDE - The initial AC voltage amplitude out of both the output channel and the reference channel.
* FREQUENCY -  The frequency of the AC signal in Hz
* POINTS_ON_GRAPH - The amount of data point the arduino will draw to simulate an AC current. More points would amount to a clearer signal. Too many point would slow the process down and result in a lower frequency.

The calculation of the amplitude at a given point is:
$A_{mp} = (DC\ VOLTAGE)+sin(2\cdot \pi \cdot step / (POINTS\ ON\ GRAPH)) \cdot (AC\ AMPLITUDE)$
#### Output 
The command outputs:

        Sine with read is running real freq : {real_freq}

Ending with a line break. {real_freq} is replace with the real expected frequency that results from the rounding errors.

#### Example 

    SINE,2,1,0.03,17,80\r

Would produce a DC voltage of $1 \ volt$ on port 2, with additional AC current with amplitude $30 \ milivolt$ using 80 points on the graph on both port 2 and port 3 (reference).

### The SINE state
The SINE command differs from other DAC-ADC command in that it never stops. You can only use a small set of commands to update the SINE signal that runs on the selected port. In order to change the status of the device (to produce a RAMP or even a different SINE signal) the Duck should be restarted (In matlab, simply using fclose(serial_device) and the fopen(serial_device)).

There are some accepted command during the SINE state, that can affect the reference, AC or DC voltages. 

#### AC
Signature :
    
    AC {voltage}\r

Updates the AC voltage amplitude of the output channel to the {voltage} specified(and only the output channel. this doesn't affect the reference channel). 

Example :
    
    AC 0.03\r

Updates the voltage amplitude of the output channel to $30 \ milivolt$. This doesn't affect the reference channel amplitude.

#### DC

Signature :
    
    DC {voltage}\r

Updates the DC voltage of the output channel to the {voltage} specified(and only the output channel. this doesn't affect the reference channel). 

Example :   

    DC 3.2\r

Updates the DC voltage of the output channel to $3.2 \ volt$. This doesn't affect the reference channel.

#### RF

Signature:
    
    RF {voltage}\r

Updates the AC voltage amplitude of the reference channel (3). This doesn't affect the output channel in any way.


Example :
    
    RF 1\r

Sets the output voltage of the reference channel to $1 \ volt$. This doesn't affect the output channel.
